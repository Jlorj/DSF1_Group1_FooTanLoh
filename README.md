## About
Hi there! Welcome to our mini Data Science project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence)!
In this project, we will be exploring some of the factors that can be used to predict a happiness score. 
Each of the following source codes contains the data cleaning, analyses, visualisations, and model predictions based on the factors that we have selected to investigate.

1. CO2 Emissions  (insert link here)
2. Internet Usage (insert link here)

## Problem Statement
- Based on a selection of factors, are we able to predict a happiness score?

- Which model is the best to predict happiness?

## Model Used
- Linear Regression

## Limitations Faced 
- Isolation Forest technique in detecting anomalies requires a good estimation of the contamination value to remove anomalies effectively. 

- Current world data on internet usage is limited - dataset contains too many NaN values for several countries, which may lead to over-estimation of the happiness index of the country.


## Concluding Remarks
