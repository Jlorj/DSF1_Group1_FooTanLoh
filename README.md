## About
Hi there! Welcome to our mini Data Science project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence)!
In this project, we will be exploring some of the factors that can be used to predict a country's happiness score. 
Each of the following source codes contains the data cleaning, analyses, visualisations, and model predictions based on the factors that we have selected to investigate.

1. CO2 Emissions  (insert link here)
2. Internet Usage (insert link here)
